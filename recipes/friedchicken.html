    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery store.</li>
        <li>Buttermilk: Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning), salt, and pepper. You can add more spices and seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li>Oil: Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point.</li>
    </ul>
