# odin-recipes

## Introduction
The "odin-recipes" project is a simple web development project where I will demonstrate the basics of HTML. In this project, I will create a basic recipe website that includes multiple pages, each containing a recipe. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- Structuring HTML documents
- Creating links between different pages
- Using lists to organize ingredients and steps
- Embedding images into web pages

This project serves as a foundational exercise in HTML, helping me to solidify my understanding of basic web development concepts.
